## The ONE THING (Daily Non-Negotiable)

> Send ONE message to ONE founder every day.

This is my GTM in its simplest form.
A day without a message is a day the business did not move.

## The Two Operating Systems

```
Mywellnessgame GTM/
├── CLAUDE.md                    ← You are here (root)
├── Value creation/              ← Demand science (what founders need)
│   └── CLAUDE.md                ← See Value creation context
└── Offer creation/              ← Supply science (how I respond)
    └── CLAUDE.md                ← See Offer creation context
```

### Value Creation OS
**What it is:** Understanding demand — who the founders are, what they are experiencing, and what signals they send.
**Core question:** What is breaking for this founder right now?
**Output:** Daily messages that create replies, not sales.

### Offer Creation OS
**What it is:** Understanding supply — how I package, position, and deliver the coaching.
**Core question:** What do I offer and how do I explain it?
**Output:** Messaging framework, product offer, and demo call structure.

> **Current focus:** Value Creation OS. Offer Creation OS is next once messaging is proven.

## The Framework I Coach

### Step 1 — The 3-Game System

| Game | Stress Type | Lens | Tense | Partnership |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Macro** | Acute | Breadth / Concepts / Qualities | Present | Thinking partner |
| **Micro** | Neither acute nor chronic | Length / Tasks / Tactics | Future | Accountability partner |
| **Nano** | Chronic | Depth / Workflows / Capabilities | Past | Coaching partner |

---

### Step 2 — Founder Types

| Type | Stress | Needs | Partnership |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Founder A** | Acute | Clarity | Thinking partner |
| **Founder B** | Neither | Action | Accountability partner |
| **Founder C** | Chronic | Lesson | Coaching partner |

### Step 3 — The 3 Debt Stages

| Debt | Definition | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| **Context Debt** | Absence of qualities/concepts | Founder can't name what is wrong |
| **Content Debt** | Absence of tasks/tactics | Knows what's wrong, doesn't know what to do |
| **Formula Debt** | Absence of workflows/capabilities | Knows what to do, no system to repeat it |

---

### Step 4 — Business Types

| Type | Stage | Problem | Game |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Business A** | 0-1 customers | Breadth without focus | Macro |
| **Business B** | 1-10 customers | Length without consistency | Micro |
| **Business C** | 10+ customers | Depth without visibility | Nano |

### Step 5 — Situation Types

Founder type (A/B/C) × Business type (A/B/C) × Debt stage (Context/Content/Formula) = Situation types

### Step 6 — Messaging Framework

How I write the message once I know the situation type.

## Outreach Philosophy

Pre-revenue GTM must be **manual, simple, and repetitive.**
No automation. No pitching. No scaling before 10 paying customers.

**Listening Mode Rules:**
- Open with what they are feeling — not what I offer
- Reference the specific signal I saw (their exact words)
- Ask one genuine question — not a pitch
- Under 100 words
- Never ask for a call in the first message

---

## Three-Tier Goal Structure

| Level | Goal |
|---|---|
| **Macro** | Get one founder to request a demo call through meaningful messaging |
| **Micro** | Send one daily message using my context files |
| **Nano** | Constantly update system files to evolve my understanding |

---

## Git Commit Habit

At the end of every day:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Day [X] — [founder name] — [what I learned]"
git push
```

The commit message is the learning log. Make it meaningful.

## How to Help Me (Claude Instructions)

1. **Act as my coach to the framework** — as you observe patterns across my messages and founder interactions, find gaps in my framework and surface them proactively. If something is missing, underdeveloped, or contradicted by what I am observing in the field, tell me directly. Don't wait for me to ask.
2. **My messages must be under 100 words** — push back if longer
3. **Never suggest automation** — manual is the strategy at this stage
4. **If I share a founder signal** — walk me through the 6 steps: Game → Founder type → Debt stage → Business type → Situation type → Message
5. **If I seem to be drifting** — remind me the ONE THING is to send today's message
