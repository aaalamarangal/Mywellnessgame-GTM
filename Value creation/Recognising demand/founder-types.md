# Founder Types

## The Rule
The 3 games (Macro, Micro, Nano) are the same for all founders.
What differs is the founder as a person — how they show up within each game.

---

## The 3 Games (Universal)

```
Macro (first): Breadth = Acute stress, Concepts/Qualities, Present tense, Thinking partnership
Micro (second): Length = Neither acute nor chronic, Tasks/Tactics, Future tense, Accountability partnership
Nano (third): Depth = Chronic stress, Workflows/Capabilities, Past tense, Coaching partnership
```

## Founder A

### At Macro (Acute stress — Thinking partner)

**What they need:** Clarity
**How they show up:** They look for a thinking partner — someone to think WITH them, not at them.

**What they are trying to think through:**
- Something is feeling urgent right now
- They can sense the breadth of the problem but can't prioritise it
- They need someone to sit with the complexity alongside them

---

### At Micro (Neither acute nor chronic — Accountability)

**What they need:** Action
**How they show up without accountability:**
- Keeps thinking instead of acting
- Starts things but doesn't finish them
- Waits for more clarity before moving
- Gets distracted by new ideas

**What good accountability looks like for Founder A:**
- Daily check in
- Help picking ONE thing to act on
- Reminder of why the action matters
- Help stopping overthinking and just starting

**Connection to mywellnessgame:**
Your journaling system serves all 3 levels — not just accountability.

```
Journal about ONE THING today
→ Thinking structure (Macro)
→ Helps founder sit with complexity and find clarity

Define next steps for ONE THING tomorrow
→ Accountability structure (Micro)
→ Commits them to action before the day starts

Assess patterns over time
→ Coaching structure (Nano)
→ Makes the invisible visible
```

---

### At Nano (Chronic stress — Coaching)

**What they need:** Lesson
**How they show up uncoached:**
- Repeating the same patterns without knowing why
- Feeling tired but can't explain where it comes from
- Knows something is wrong but can't name it
- Has tried many solutions but nothing sticks

**What good coaching looks like for Founder A:**
- Helping them see the pattern that has been invisible
- Naming what they have normalized
- Connecting the tiredness to a specific cause
- Making the chronic visible before suggesting any solution

**Why accountability won't work here:**
You can't hold someone accountable to changing a pattern they can't even see yet.
Coaching must come before accountability at the Nano level.
