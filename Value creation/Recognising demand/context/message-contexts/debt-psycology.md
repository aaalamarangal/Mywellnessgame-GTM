Built from two sources:
1. Shiva's lived experience as Founder A
2. Exact words from founders observed in the field

## Context Debt — How it feels

**Definition:** Absence of qualities and/or concepts in a given situation.

**Shiva's lived experience:**
"I was not aligning my astrological framework into my daily experiences. Once I did — the context debt released. The concept was always available. I just wasn't applying it to what I was living."

**What this means for founders:**
Context Debt feels like the problem is the enemy — yourself, others, or the environment.
The founder can't name what's wrong because they don't have the concept to name it with.
Resolution comes when the right concept meets the right experience.

**From the field:**
> "Most of what feels hard hasn't actually been about the stage of the company, or even the problem we're facing. The bigger factor has been how I relate to the problem... it comes from the story we attach to it."
— Thenuka Karunaratne

## Core Insight
"I love supporting people to regulate themselves — and productivity can be defined by the individual."
— Shiva Kumar

Self-regulation is the foundation.
Before any task or workflow can work — the founder must first have the concept of what regulation feels like for them.
