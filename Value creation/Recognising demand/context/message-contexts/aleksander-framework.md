# Aleksander Framework — Pre-Revenue Outreach

## Core Belief
Pre-revenue GTM should be manual, simple, and repetitive.
Automation is too early at this stage.
Most growth problems are actually messaging problems.

## The 4 Steps

### Step 1 — Test Messaging in Public
Post consistently on LinkedIn and chase signals, not vanity metrics.
- Watch which angles trigger replies
- Track which DMs you get and who ignores you and why
- This is signal chasing — it is the only way to know what resonates before you invest in outreach

### Step 2 — Push Direct Outreach (Listening Mode)
Reach out to understand, not to sell.
- Ask how they currently solve the problem you are targeting
- Find out where they get stuck
- Understand what they report internally
- Write down the EXACT phrases they use
This builds the language you will use in all future messaging.

### Step 3 — Get on Calls Early
Show up even before the product is perfect.
- The mismatch between how you describe it and how they explain it back = your messaging gap
- Calls are how you course-correct before you waste resources on the wrong story

### Step 4 — First Milestone: 10 Paying Customers
Do not think about scaling until you have 10 paying customers.
- Build your waitlist manually through LinkedIn and website
- Once you have 10, you have proof the messaging works

## How to Write a Listening-Mode Message

**Before you write — identify:**
1. Which founder type are they? (A / B / C) — see `founder-types.md`
2. Which game is breaking? (Macro / Micro / Nano)
3. Which debt stage? (Context / Content / Formula)
4. Which situation number? (1–27) — see `demand-science-27-situations.md`
5. What signal did you see? (post, comment, DM, profile)

**Message structure:**
1. Open with what they are feeling — not what you offer
2. Reference the specific signal you saw (their post, their words)
3. Ask one genuine question — not a pitch
4. Keep it under 5 lines

**What to never do:**
- Never lead with your product
- Never ask for a call in the first message
- Never use corporate language
- Never send the same message to two founders

## Message Template (adapt every time)

```
Hi [name],

[One line referencing something specific they posted or said — their exact words if possible]

[One line naming what you noticed — the feeling or situation behind it]

[One genuine question about their experience — not a pitch]

[Your name]
```

## After You Send

Log everything in `daily-message-log.md`:
- What signal you saw
- Which situation number you identified
- The message you sent
- What happened (reply / silence / reaction)
- What you learned about their founder type
