# Situation Types

## The Rule
Situations are the Having layer — the result of who the founder is (Being)
combined with where their business is (Doing).

Founder (Being) + Business (Doing) = Situation (Having)

There are 9 base situations (3 founder types × 3 business types).
Each situation can then be in one of 3 debt stages (Context, Content, Formula).
This produces 27 total situations.
