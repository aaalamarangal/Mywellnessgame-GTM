# Daily Message Log

## The Rule
One message. One founder. Every day.
This log is where your micro goal compounds into your macro goal.
Every entry builds your understanding of Founder B and C.

## How to Use This Log

**Before you write the message:**
1. Find the founder on LinkedIn
2. Identify their founder type (A / B / C) — use `founder-types.md`
3. Identify which game is breaking — use `3-game-system.md`
4. Find their situation number (1-27) — use `demand-science-27-situations.md`
5. Write the message from their feeling — not from your solution

**After you get a response (or silence):**
1. Log what happened
2. Note what you learned about their founder type
3. Update `founder-types.md` if you observed something new about B or C
