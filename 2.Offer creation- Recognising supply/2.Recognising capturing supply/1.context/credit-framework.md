# Credit Framework
Parent: CLAUDE.md | Remembering-supply/claude.md | offer-positioning.md | product-messaging.md

## Purpose
Credits are the opposite of Debt.
When a credit is present, the founder can produce the necessary output for that game.
When a debt is present, the output is blocked.

Debt maps to the problem dimension.
Credit maps to the solution dimension.

## The Credit / Debt Polarity

| Debt | Problem dimension | Credit | Solution dimension | Game | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Context Debt | Breadth of problem | Clarity Credit | Breadth of solution | Macro | Speed |
| Content Debt | Length of problem | Action Credit | Length of solution | Micro | Leverage |
| Formula Debt | Depth of problem | Lesson Credit | Depth of solution | Nano | Multiplier |

## The Three Credits

### Clarity Credit
**Opposite of:** Context Debt (absence of qualities / concepts)
**Game:** Macro
**Solution dimension:** Breadth — the founder can see across the full scope and know what matters first
**Focus area:** Speed
**What speed means here:** Founders in acute stress need to finish fast. Speed is about collapsing breadth — cutting through the options quickly to land on what matters now. Not deliberating. Orienting.
**What it unlocks:** The founder can name what is wrong and move toward what matters first
**What it feels like when present:** The acute stress resolves. The breadth becomes navigable. The founder stops making themselves, others, or the environment the enemy.

### Action Credit
**Opposite of:** Content Debt (absence of tasks / tactics)
**Game:** Micro
**Solution dimension:** Length — the founder can see the full sequence and know what to do next
**Focus area:** Leverage
**What leverage means here:** Do less to move more. The ONE thing, done well, moves the whole sequence forward.
**What it unlocks:** The founder moves from knowing to doing — picks the ONE thing and executes it
**What it feels like when present:** The paralysis lifts. The founder stops overthinking and starts. One committed action compounds into the next.

---

### Lesson Credit
**Opposite of:** Formula Debt (absence of workflows / capabilities)
**Game:** Nano
**Solution dimension:** Depth — the founder can see beneath the surface to the pattern that has been running
**Focus area:** Multiplier
**What multiplier means here:** A lesson learned at depth compounds across weeks. One insight changes many future decisions.
**What it unlocks:** The founder can see what has been invisible — the repeating patterns that drain or sustain them
**What it feels like when present:** The chronic stress becomes legible. The founder stops repeating the same pattern without knowing why. Lessons compound.

## How Credits Connect to the Offer

| Credit | Focus | Offer tool | Coach role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Clarity Credit | Speed | To do | Thinking partner — names what is actually weighing on the founder |
| Action Credit | Leverage | Assessment | Accountability partner — holds the founder to the ONE thing |
| Lesson Credit | Multiplier | Journal | Coaching partner — makes the invisible visible over time |
