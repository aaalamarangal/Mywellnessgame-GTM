# Offer Creation OS — Claude.md

## Core Rule: Build Skills, Not Products
The game is to package founder productivity expertise as reusable, AI-callable skills.
(Greg Isenberg's Skill Era framework)

The full stack:

```
CLI  = where the founder works (Claude Code terminal)
MCP  = the connector that plugs your skill into their CLI
Skill = your judgment (debt diagnosis — why the founder is stuck)
API  = the mechanical tools underneath (fetch data, manage tasks)
```

An API is a doorway into a function.
A skill is a doorway into judgment.
MCP is the plug that makes the skill callable.
CLI is the surface where the founder experiences it.

Your game is building the skill. CLI and MCP are delivery mechanisms — they may evolve or replace each other. The skill stays the same regardless of how it's delivered.

## What This Means for mywellnessgame
- Your 3-Game Framework, debt diagnosis, and tollgate system are not just methodology — they are potential skills
- Document your judgment process (how you diagnose, decide, and message) — this is the distributable IP
- The barrier to building software is lowering; the barrier to encoding real-world expertise is rising

## CLI vs API vs Skill vs MCP

```
CLI  = the surface (interface — where the founder types and works)
API  = the tool (function — "here's how to manage your to-do list")
Skill = the judgment (diagnosis — "here's why your to-do list drains you")
MCP  = the connector (delivery — lets a founder's AI call your skill while they work)
```

**CLI** — the terminal where the founder works (Claude Code). This is where they're staring at their task list, feeling stuck.
**API** — any productivity app does this (Notion, Todoist). Manages tasks mechanically.
**Skill** — only your framework does this. Diagnoses why a founder freezes at their task list. Context Debt, Content Debt, or Formula Debt.
**MCP** — the plumbing that lets AI agents access your skill. You don't build this. You build the judgment that flows through it.

Your game is building skills. CLI is where founders experience it. MCP is how it gets delivered. API is the mechanical layer underneath.
Founders setting up Claude Code for non-technical work are already in the CLI — they just don't have the skill plugged in yet.

## Current Status
Offer Creation OS activates once Value Creation OS messaging is proven.
One reply at a time. Skills get packaged from validated patterns, not theory.

## The Offer (Draft — to be validated through demand)

Enabling founders to finish the ONE THING that moves the needle for the day — using their todo, assessment, and journal as a thinking/accountability/coaching partner — with a custom MCP layer added to their Claude Code.

**How the offer maps to the framework:**

```
Todo        → Thinking partner    → Macro game (what matters right now?)
Assessment  → Accountability partner → Micro game (did I do the one thing?)
Journal     → Coaching partner    → Nano game (what patterns am I repeating?)
```

**What the founder buys:** Finish the one thing that moves the needle.
**What delivers it:** Your debt diagnosis skill running through their Claude Code via MCP.
**What they don't need to know:** The 3-Game Framework, debt stages, or how MCP works.

**Pushback to remember:**
- Lead with "finish the one thing" — not with MCP. Founders buy the water, not the plumbing.
- This offer needs validation through real founder messages before it becomes final.
- The todo, assessment, and journal are surfaces. The real skill is diagnosing why the founder is stuck.
- The 3-Game Framework, debt diagnosis, and tollgate system still have gaps. They need to evolve through real founder interactions before they can be packaged as skills. Don't package theory — package validated patterns.

## The Coach Role — How You Show Up

| Lens | Founder Shares | Coach Role | Game |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recognise | To-do list | Thinking Partner | Macro (Context Debt) |
| Remember | Assessment | Accountability Partner | Micro (Content Debt) |
| Review | Journal | Coaching Partner | Nano (Formula Debt) |

**Recognise** — founder shares their to-do list. Coach is a thinking partner. Helps them see what matters right now.
**Remember** — founder shares their assessment. Coach is an accountability partner. Holds them to the one thing.
**Review** — founder shares their journal. Coach is a coaching partner. Makes invisible patterns visible.

The diagnostic (demand side) tells you where the founder is stuck.
The coach role (offer side) tells you how you show up to help them move.
