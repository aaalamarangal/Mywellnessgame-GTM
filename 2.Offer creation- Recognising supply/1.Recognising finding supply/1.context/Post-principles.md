# Post Principles

## Purpose
Patterns observed in how founders publicly share their personal operating systems.
This informs how Shiva eventually talks about mywellnessgame — not as a pitch, but as lived experience.

## Why This Matters

When a founder shares their system publicly, they're not selling.
They're describing something that worked for them.
The post itself becomes a signal for other founders who need the same thing.

Understanding how these posts work helps you:
1. Recognise founders who are already doing regulation work (even if they don't call it that)
2. Learn the language founders use to describe these needs
3. Build your own voice for when you start posting

## Stephen Whitworth — Post Anatomy

**Post type:** "Here's what I built and why it works"
**Tone:** Peer sharing, not teaching. Uses "I've found" and "I'm experimenting" — not prescriptive.
**Structure:**
- Opens with a reframe: "Most people use AI coding tools to write code. I'm using it for something different."
- Lists specific use cases with real examples
- Closes with the key insight: the most value comes from work that would never have happened otherwise

**What makes it effective:**
- Specificity — he names exact tools (Granola, Slack, Salesforce, Gong)
- Vulnerability — he says "experimenting with" not "I've mastered"
- The frame is personal operating system, not productivity hack

**Language patterns worth noting:**
- "Mini coach + chief of staff" — combining two roles into one concept
- "Gentle and useful accountability system" — gentle is the key word
- "Force forward progress on hard problems" — force, not manage
- "Work that would never have happened" — the invisible ROI argument

## Gaurav Verma (Senior Software Engineer) — Post Anatomy

**Post type:** "Here's what shifted for me and why it matters"
**Tone:** Peer sharing. Uses "I now think" and "what surprised me" — personal discovery, not instruction.
**Note:** Gaurav is not a founder — he is an engineering leader. This post is a language and structure reference, not a prospect signal.
**Structure:**
- Opens with a reframe: "What surprised me wasn't that it writes code. We've all seen that."
- Narrows to the specific insight: clarity of intent as the new bottleneck
- Uses a before/after frame: old thinking → new thinking
- Closes with a question to the audience

**What makes it effective:**
- The before/after frame is clean and relatable
- He names the old constraint ("typing speed") before naming the new one ("clarity of intent")
- Ends with a question that invites peers in, not followers

**Language patterns worth noting:**
- "Let me define this properly" — shift from doing to defining
- "Clarity of intent" — names the bottleneck without jargon
- "A very fast junior architect who never gets tired" — humanizes the tool without overstating it
- "It amplifies the quality of thinking" — AI as multiplier, not replacement
- "The bottleneck is no longer typing speed" — reframes the old constraint
- "Who can think cleanly and define systems precisely?" — new skillset in one question

**Post structure to borrow:**
Personal experience → specific example → insight → implication for others

## Principles Extracted

### 1. Reframe first, list second
Start with what makes your approach different from the obvious use case.
Stephen: "Most people use AI tools to code. I use it as a personal OS."
For you: "Most founders think productivity is about doing more. I help them regulate first."

### 2. Name the tools, not the theory
Founders trust specifics. Stephen lists Todoist, Slack, Linear, Notion, Salesforce, Gong.
For you: name the familiar tools — journaling, daily check-in, weekly review — not the framework behind them.

### 3. Use "experimenting" language
"I'm experimenting with" = I'm still learning, come join me.
"I've built" = here's my finished product, judge it.
The first invites conversation. The second invites comparison.

### 4. Close with invisible ROI
The strongest line in Stephen's post: "The most benefit comes from work that would never have happened."
This is not about speed. It's not even just leverage.
It's about work that only happens when the conditions underneath are right.
Gaurav's framing adds the next layer: "It amplifies the quality of thinking."
The invisible ROI is not doing more or doing faster — it's doing the work that your current state of thinking would never have unlocked alone.

### 5. Use before/after framing
Gaurav: "Instead of thinking: 'Let me code this.' I now think: 'Let me define this properly.'"
This structure is transferable. Name the old way. Name the new way. Let the reader feel the shift.

## When You Start Posting

Not yet. Build the offer first, prove it with one founder, then share from lived experience.
But when you do — these principles are your starting structure.
