## Purpose
Patterns observed in how founders publicly share their personal operating systems.
This informs how Shiva eventually talks about mywellnessgame — not as a pitch, but as lived experience.

## Why This Matters

When a founder shares their system publicly, they're not selling.
They're describing something that worked for them.
The post itself becomes a signal for other founders who need the same thing.

Understanding how these posts work helps you:
1. Recognise founders who are already doing regulation work (even if they don't call it that)
2. Learn the language founders use to describe these needs
3. Build your own voice for when you start posting

## Stephen Whitworth — Post Anatomy

**Post type:** "Here's what I built and why it works"
**Tone:** Peer sharing, not teaching. Uses "I've found" and "I'm experimenting" — not prescriptive.
**Structure:**
- Opens with a reframe: "Most people use AI coding tools to write code. I'm using it for something different."
- Lists specific use cases with real examples
- Closes with the key insight: the most value comes from work that would never have happened otherwise

**What makes it effective:**
- Specificity — he names exact tools (Granola, Slack, Salesforce, Gong)
- Vulnerability — he says "experimenting with" not "I've mastered"
- The frame is personal operating system, not productivity hack

**Language patterns worth noting:**
- "Mini coach + chief of staff" — combining two roles into one concept
- "Gentle and useful accountability system" — gentle is the key word
- "Force forward progress on hard problems" — force, not manage
- "Work that would never have happened" — the invisible ROI argument

## Principles Extracted

### 1. Reframe first, list second
Start with what makes your approach different from the obvious use case.
Stephen: "Most people use AI tools to code. I use it as a personal OS."
For you: "Most founders think productivity is about doing more. I help them regulate first."

### 2. Name the tools, not the theory
Founders trust specifics. Stephen lists Todoist, Slack, Linear, Notion, Salesforce, Gong.
For you: name the familiar tools — journaling, daily check-in, weekly review — not the framework behind them.

### 3. Use "experimenting" language
"I'm experimenting with" = I'm still learning, come join me.
"I've built" = here's my finished product, judge it.
The first invites conversation. The second invites comparison.

### 4. Close with invisible ROI
The strongest line in Stephen's post: "The most benefit comes from work that would never have happened."
This is not about speed. It's about doing the work you'd otherwise skip.

## When You Start Posting

Not yet. Build the offer first, prove it with one founder, then share from lived experience.
But when you do — these principles are your starting structure.
