# Offer Positioning
Parent: CLAUDE.md | sources.md

## Purpose
How mywellnessgame positions against alternatives in the market.
Not a pitch deck — a thinking tool for understanding where your offer sits
relative to what founders are already doing.

## The JTBD Lens (from Robert Kaminski)

Founders don't compare you to other coaches.
They compare you to whatever they're currently doing to solve the same job.

The job: **Stay regulated, focused, and productive as a founder under stress.**

---

## Competition Map — What Founders Actually Use

| Alternative | What it does | What it misses |
|---|---|---|
| **DIY AI system** (Claude Code, ChatGPT + tools) | Task management, knowledge retrieval, accountability prompts | No regulation work underneath — manages tasks, not the founder's relationship to tasks |
| **Journaling apps** (Day One, Notion journals) | Capture thoughts | No pattern recognition, no accountability, no thinking partner |
| **Generic ChatGPT** | Answers questions, brainstorms | No persistent context, no framework, no commitment structure |
| **Doing nothing** | Founders push through on willpower | Leads to burnout, invisible patterns, chronic stress |
| **Therapy / traditional coaching** | Deep personal work | Not embedded in the workday, feels separate from productivity |
| **Peer groups** (YC batch, founder communities) | Social accountability | Inconsistent, no daily structure, depends on who shows up |

## Your Offer — What Makes It Different

### The Three Capabilities

| Your capability | What the founder sees | What it does underneath |
|---|---|---|
| **Journal** | "Name what's weighing on you today" | Regulation — the founder processes before reacting |
| **One commitment** | "Pick the ONE THING before the day pulls you" | Focus — prevents scattered execution |
| **Patterns** | "See why some weeks drain and others don't" | Coaching — makes the invisible visible |

### The Key Insight

Founders buy something that sounds like it fits into their workday.
Familiar tools that do something different underneath.

The journal looks like a productivity tool. It does regulation work.
The one commitment looks like task management. It does focus work.
The patterns look like a weekly review. It does coaching work.

## Stephen Whitworth Validation

Stephen built all three capabilities into his own Claude Code setup:
- **Self-reflection and persistent memory** = your Journal
- **"What should I focus on today?" against weekly targets** = your One commitment
- **Knowledge distillation and queryable transcripts** = your Patterns

He proved the need is real. But he solved it through code.
Most founders can't build what Stephen built.
They need a person to do the regulation work with them, not a system they configure themselves.

**Your differentiation:** You do the regulation work underneath. His system manages tasks. Yours changes the founder's relationship to the tasks.

**His insight that validates your pricing:** "The most benefit comes from work that would never have happened in the first place because it was far too expensive to do." Your coaching makes this work happen. Without you, founders skip it because it feels too expensive relative to urgent work.

---

## Positioning Statement (Draft)

**For founders who know what good looks like but can't access it consistently.**

Not another productivity tool.
Not therapy.

A daily system that uses familiar work tools — journaling, commitment, pattern review —
to do the regulation work that makes everything else sustainable.

## Open Questions

- How do you price against "free" alternatives like ChatGPT and journaling apps?
- Does the regulation framing resonate with founders, or do they need productivity language first?
- At what point does a founder realize they need a person, not a tool?
