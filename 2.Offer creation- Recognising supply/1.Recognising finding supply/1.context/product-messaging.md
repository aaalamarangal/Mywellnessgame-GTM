## Product Capabilities (By using)

1. Journal to name what's actually weighing on you today
2. One commitment before the day pulls you in ten directions
3. Patterns that show you why some weeks drain you and others don't

**Design principle:** Familiar objects (journal, todo, assessment) that quietly do regulation work. Founders buy something that fits into their workday. The magic is that these familiar objects do something different.

---

## Key Features (That enables)

1. Coach reads your journal to confirm whether you named the real thing or the surface thing
2. Custom MCP layer on Claude Code that builds persistent context across days
3. Assessment system that connects your energy to your decisions over time

---

## Instant Solution (Without)

1. Your todo energises you instead of draining you
2. When energy drops, you know what's causing it — not just that it happened
3. You stop making yourself, others, or your environment the enemy

---

## Everyday Problem (Because of)

1. Staring at the todo list and feeling paralysed instead of energised
2. Pushing through without noticing what's actually draining you
3. Blaming yourself, your team, or your circumstances when things aren't working

---

## Competitive Advantage (To improve)

*Hypotheses to validate through messaging sprints:*
- DIY journaling in Notion lacks persistent context and coaching feedback
- ChatGPT as thinking partner has no memory across days and no framework
- General business coaches don't integrate into the founder's daily workflow tools
- No system at all = founders repeat invisible patterns indefinitely

---

## Current Way (Because we handle)

*What we know so far:*
- Some founders journal but never review patterns
- Some use AI assistants for thinking but context resets every session
- Some have coaches but the coaching doesn't connect to daily execution
- Most founders have no regulation system — they push through until they burn out

---

## ICP's Objections

*Hypotheses to validate through messaging sprints:*
- "I don't think I have a productivity problem" (Context Debt — can't name what's wrong)
- "I've tried journaling before and it didn't stick" (Content Debt — had the tool but not the structure)
- "I don't have time for another system" (Formula Debt — doesn't see how it fits into existing workflow)

## Unique Product Offer

**Version 1 — Full offer (for website, sales pitch, long-form):**

*The problem you live with:*
You stare at the todo list and feel paralysed. You push through without noticing what's draining you. When things break, you blame yourself, your team, or your circumstances.

*What changes:*
Your todo energises you instead of draining you. When energy drops, you know what's causing it. You stop making yourself the enemy.

*How it works:*
A journal that names what's actually weighing on you. One commitment before the day pulls you apart. Patterns that show you why some weeks drain you and others don't.

*What you get:*
A coaching layer built into Claude Code — your journal, todo, and assessment become a thinking partner that remembers your context across days.

---

**Version 1 — One-liner (for social media, ads, DMs):**

Stop staring at your todo list wondering why nothing moves. Journal what's actually weighing on you, commit to one thing before the day pulls you apart, and see the patterns behind your best and worst weeks — through a coaching layer built into the tools you already use.

**Testing notes:**
- This version leads with the paralysis problem — validate whether this is the broadest pain across ICP
- Field signals so far suggest multiple entry points: relating to problems differently (Thenuka), wanting a regulated state (Ross), self-management as operating system (Adarsh)
- Future messaging sprints may produce situation-specific versions of this offer
- Update this section as tollgate responses reveal what lands and what doesn't
