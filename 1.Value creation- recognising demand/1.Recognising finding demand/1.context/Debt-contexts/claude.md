# Debt-contexts — claude.md
Parent: CLAUDE.md | Recognising finding demand

## Purpose
This folder contains the understanding layer.
Before writing any message, Claude must read this folder to understand WHO the founder is and WHAT they are experiencing.

## What Lives Here

### founder-types.md
Who the founder is as a person — how they show up within each game.
Founder A is fully built from lived experience.
Founder B and C to be built from real founder observations.

### business-types.md
Where the business is — what stage it is at and how it shows up within each game.
Business A (0-1 customers), Business B (1-10 customers), Business C (10+ customers).

### situation-types.md
The Having layer — the result of Founder (Being) + Business (Doing).
9 base situations (3 founder types × 3 business types).
Each situation can be in one of 3 debt stages — producing 27 total situations.

### debt-psychology.md
The psychological texture of each debt stage — not just what the debt is, but how it feels from the inside.
Built from Shiva's lived experience as Founder A and exact words from founders observed in the field.

### coaching-diagnostic.md
The 6-layer diagnostic framework for finding where a founder is stuck on their ONE THING.
The path: Goal → Concepts → Qualities → Tasks → Tactics → Workflows → Capabilities
Maps directly to the 3 debt stages and explains the indirect shift principle — you can't directly shift the thing you're stuck at, you shift the adjacent layer.

## How to Use This Folder

1. Read founder-types.md — identify which founder type this is (A, B, or C)
2. Read business-types.md — identify which business type this is (A, B, or C)
3. Read situation-types.md — map the combination to identify the situation type
4. Read debt-psychology.md — understand how this debt stage feels from the inside
5. Read coaching-diagnostic.md — identify where exactly the founder is stuck on their ONE THING (which of the 6 layers is the constraint)
6. Then move to Message-contexts to translate this understanding into a message

## The Core Logic
Founder (Being) + Business (Doing) = Situation (Having)
Situation + Debt stage = Where the job breaks
Where the job breaks = Where the message starts
