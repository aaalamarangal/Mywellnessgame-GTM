# ONE THING Coaching Diagnostic
Parent: CLAUDE.md | founder-types.md | situation-types.md | debt-psychology.md

## Purpose
This is the diagnostic framework for finding where a founder is stuck on their ONE THING.
The coach's job: find the constraint on this path. That's the bottleneck. Everything else is downstream.

---

## The Path
Goal → Concepts → Qualities → Tasks → Tactics → Workflows → Capabilities

This is the path from being to doing to having for any ONE THING a founder wants to get done.

---

## How It Maps to Debt Stages

```
Context Debt  = Concepts + Qualities
  Concepts  — the understanding of what the situation is and what matters in it
  Qualities — the energy, mindset and character needed to show up in it

Content Debt  = Tasks + Tactics
  Tasks     — the specific actions that need to be done
  Tactics   — the decisions and moves made in the moment to execute them

Formula Debt  = Workflows + Capabilities
  Workflows    — the repeatable routines that keep execution consistent
  Capabilities — the ability to produce the outcome repeatedly
```

---

## Inner Game vs Outer Game

```
Outer Game (Limited — time, flexibility, resources)
  → Concepts, Tasks, Workflows

Inner Game (Unlimited — energy, flexibility, resources)
  → Qualities, Tactics, Capabilities
```

The Outer Game can be borrowed or copied. The Inner Game has to be developed — you can't quote your way into it.

## The Diagnostic — Six Questions

1. Does the founder lack **Concepts** (doesn't understand what it is)?
2. Does the founder lack **Qualities** (doesn't know what good looks like)?
3. Does the founder lack **Tasks** (doesn't know what to do)?
4. Does the founder lack **Tactics** (doesn't know how to do it)?
5. Does the founder lack **Workflows** (can't execute it consistently)?
6. Does the founder lack **Capabilities** (can't produce the outcome repeatedly)?

## Where to Focus When Stuck — The Indirect Shift

You can't directly shift the thing you're stuck at. You shift the adjacent layer.

### Understanding the Context Game

**Stuck at Concepts**
Can't directly shift concepts. Reflect on capabilities achieved in a similar situation, define what can be achieved now, and that evolves not just concepts but also triggers building necessary qualities. If unable to envision, find someone who did this and think through it together.

**Stuck at Qualities**
Can't directly shift qualities. Reflect on concepts held in a similar situation, define what can be envisioned as a concept now, and that evolves not just qualities but also triggers building necessary tasks. If unable to envision, find someone who did this and think through it together.

### Understanding the Content Game

**Stuck at Tasks**
Can't directly shift tasks. Reflect on qualities experienced in a similar situation, define who they can be now, and that evolves not just tasks but also triggers building necessary tactics. If unable to envision, find someone who did this and think through it together.

**Stuck at Tactics**
Can't directly shift tactics. Reflect on the task list from a similar situation, define what tactics can be envisioned now, and that evolves not just tactics but also triggers building necessary workflows. If unable to envision, find someone who did this and think through it together.

### Understanding the Formula Game

**Stuck at Workflows**
Can't directly shift workflows. Reflect on tactics built for a similar situation, define the tactics for this situation, and that evolves not just workflows but also triggers building necessary capabilities. If unable to envision, find someone who did this and think through it together.

**Stuck at Capabilities**
Can't directly shift capabilities. Reflect on workflows built for a similar situation, define the capabilities for this situation, and that evolves not just capabilities but also triggers building necessary qualities. If unable to envision, find someone who did this and think through it together.

At every level — if the founder can't envision the shift, that's where the coach enters.

## The Sport Analogy

```
Concepts    — understanding the game, the rules and the field
Qualities   — the fitness, mindset and character you bring
Tasks       — the drills and training to get match ready
Tactics     — the moves and decisions in the moment
Workflows   — the daily practice routine that keeps you match fit
Capabilities — winning matches repeatedly and consistently
```

You can watch a hundred matches and know the game — but without the fitness to play, the drills to practice, the moves to execute, the routine to stay sharp, you will never win consistently.
