# Inertia Types
Parent: CLAUDE.md | Message-contexts

## Purpose
Every message you write is competing against one of these 4 mental models — not against another coach or tool.
If your message doesn't confront one of these directly, founders will default to doing nothing.

Before writing any message ask: **Which inertia am I writing against?**
If you can't answer this — you don't have a message yet.

## The 4 Inertia Types

| # | Inertia Type | What the founder says | Your counter |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Status quo | "I already have a routine" | Show what the routine is costing them invisibly |
| **2** | Internal solution | "I built my own system" | Show what the system can't see about themselves |
| **3** | Ad hoc workaround | "I journal sometimes / talk to friends" | Show why fragmented regulation doesn't compound |
| **4** | Not a priority | "I'll sort this when things calm down" | Show that things won't calm down without this |

## Inertia Type 1 — Status Quo

**What the founder says:** "I already have a routine"
**What it means:** The friction is known, accepted, and already budgeted. It's inefficient but familiar.
**Your counter:** Show what the routine is costing them invisibly — not the inefficiency they can see, but the pattern they can't.
**Founder type most likely here:** Founder C — has been doing the same thing for a long time, patterns invisible
**LinkedIn signal examples:**

## Inertia Type 2 — Internal Solution

**What the founder says:** "I built my own system" / "I could build this myself"
**What it means:** Perceived control feels safer than buying. They believe they've already solved it.
**Your counter:** Show what the system can't see about themselves — the regulation layer underneath that no system captures.
**Founder type most likely here:** Founder A — acute stress, has tried to solve it themselves, still can't access the regulated state consistently
**LinkedIn signal examples:**
- [ ] Example 1

## Inertia Type 3 — Ad Hoc Workaround

**What the founder says:** "I journal sometimes" / "I talk to friends when things get hard"
**What it means:** A fragile combo of habits and people that technically gets the job done. It avoids change and new decisions.
**Your counter:** Show why fragmented regulation doesn't compound — occasional journaling without structure doesn't build patterns.
**Founder type most likely here:** Founder B — has some tactics but no consistent system
**LinkedIn signal examples:**
- [ ] Example 1

---

## Inertia Type 4 — Not a Priority

**What the founder says:** "I'll sort this when things calm down"
**What it means:** Nice to solve but not urgent compared to everything else on fire. Attention is spent elsewhere.
**Your counter:** Show that things won't calm down without this — the regulation layer is what makes everything else sustainable.
**Founder type most likely here:** Founder A — acute stress, too many fires, regulation feels like a luxury
**LinkedIn signal examples:**
- [ ] Example 1

## How This Connects to Signal → Bridge → Voice

```
Signal  — what the founder said (founder-observations.md)
Bridge  — which inertia are you writing against? (this file)
Voice   — express it naturally with no pitch (under 100 words, one question)
```

The inertia type is the **bridge** between the founder's signal and your message.
It tells you what mental model you need to break before the founder will even consider moving.
