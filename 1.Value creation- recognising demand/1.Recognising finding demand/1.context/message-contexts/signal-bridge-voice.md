# Signal → Bridge → Voice
Parent: CLAUDE.md | Message-contexts

## Purpose
Great outreach is a pipeline, not an art.
This file is the translation layer — how to go from a founder signal to a message that creates a reply.

Before writing any message, walk through all 3 steps in sequence.
If you can't complete a step — stop. You don't have a message yet.

## The Pipeline

```
Signal → Bridge → Voice
```

**Signal** — find something specific about the founder
**Bridge** — connect the signal to the inertia they're stuck in
**Voice** — express it naturally with no pitch

---

## Step 1 — Signal

**What it is:** A specific, real thing the founder said or shared publicly.
**Where to find it:** founder-observations.md
**How to read it:** Use Debt-contexts to understand who the founder is and what they are experiencing.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Do I have the founder's exact words?
- [ ] Have I identified their founder type (A, B, or C)?
- [ ] Have I identified their situation type (A+A, A+B, etc.)?
- [ ] Have I identified their debt stage (Context, Content, or Formula)?
- [ ] Is this founder blocked or coping? (Rob Snyder)

**If you can't check all boxes — you don't have a signal yet. Don't write.**

## Step 2 — Bridge

**What it is:** The connection between the founder's signal and the inertia they're stuck in.
**Where to find it:** inertia-types.md
**How to identify it:** Ask — which of the 4 inertia types is this founder defaulting to?

```
1. Status quo       — friction is known, accepted, already budgeted
2. Internal solution — "I built my own system"
3. Ad hoc workaround — fragile combo of habits that technically works
4. Not a priority   — nice to solve but not urgent right now
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Have I identified which inertia type this founder is in?
- [ ] Do I know where their job breaks in the daily workflow? (founder-types.md)
- [ ] Can I connect their signal to the breakdown point in one sentence?

**If you can't check all boxes — you don't have a bridge yet. Don't write.**

## Step 3 — Voice

**What it is:** The message itself — expressed naturally with no pitch.
**How to write it:** Lead with what you sensed, not with your solution.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Is it under 100 words?
- [ ] Does it reference their exact words?
- [ ] Is there exactly one question?
- [ ] Does it lead with what I sensed — not my framework or solution?
- [ ] Would this create a reply or a sale?

**If you can't check all boxes — rewrite before sending.**

## The Full Sequence

```
1. Find the signal (founder-observations.md)
2. Read the signal (Debt-contexts folder)
3. Identify the inertia (inertia-types.md)
4. Find where the job breaks (founder-types.md)
5. Write the message (under 100 words, one question, no pitch)
6. Check the voice checklist before sending
7. Log it (founder-observations.md)
```

## Examples

| Founder | Signal | Bridge | Voice |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thenuka | "You can't really download it" | Not a priority — knows dialogue matters but hasn't sought a thinking partner | Led with resonance from lived experience, asked one question about how he processes hard problems |
| Ross | "Wish this was my usual state" | Internal solution — trying to regulate through nature/camping but can't access it consistently | Led with his exact words, connected to his pattern of vulnerable sharing |
| Stephen | "Maybe I just give it my credit card and yolo" | Internal solution — built his own Claude Code OS but missing the regulation layer | To be written |

## The Rule
A message without a signal is a pitch.
A message without a bridge is an observation.
A message with all three creates a reply.
