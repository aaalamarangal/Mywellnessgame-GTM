## Rob Snyder — Demand Framework

**Source:** Rob Snyder
**Core concept:** Coping Pull vs Blocked Pull — demand exists on a spectrum of urgency
**Where it applies:** Step 1 of thinking path — recognising the signal
**How to apply:** Before messaging, ask — is this founder coping or blocked?
**Example in action:** Ross Geiger commenting "Wish this was my usual state" = Blocked Pull. He can't move forward without solving this. Message now.

## Yusuf Ahmed — Signal, Bridge, Voice

**Source:** Yusuf Ahmed
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/itsyusufahmed/
**Core concept:** Great outreach is a pipeline — Signal → Bridge → Voice. Not an art.
- Signal — find something specific about the prospect
- Bridge — connect the signal to a problem you solve
- Voice — express it naturally with no pitch
**Where it applies:** Steps 1-4 of thinking path
**How to apply:** Before writing — do you have a real signal? If not, don't write yet.
**Example in action:** *(to be added)*

## Aleksander Radosevic — Messaging Framework

**Source:** Aleksander Radosevic
**Core concept:** Where the job breaks — write the message there. Not at your solution.
**Where it applies:** Step 3 of thinking path — translating signal into message
**How to apply:** Find exactly where the founder's job breaks down. Start the message at that breakdown point.
**Example in action:** *(to be added)*

## Robert Kaminski — Differentiated Messaging

**Source:** Robert Kaminski — An Irresistible Offer
**Core concept:** Problem/Solution Value Proposition — lead with the everyday problem the founder already experiences, not with your product features.
**Where it applies:** Step 3 of thinking path — translating signal into message
**How to apply:** Before writing — can you name the everyday problem in their language? If not, you don't have a message yet.
**Example in action:** *(to be added — reference product-messaging-framework.md for mywellnessgame example)*

## Stephen Whitworth — The DIY Competition

**Source:** Stephen Whitworth
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenwhitworth/
**Core concept:** The real competition for founder coaching is not other coaches — it's founders building their own AI operating systems with Claude Code, Notion, Slack, and other tools.
**Where it applies:** Offer Creation OS — understanding what you compete against
**How to apply:** Before positioning your offer, ask — could this founder build this themselves with AI tools? If yes, your differentiation is the regulation work underneath, not the task management on top.
**Example in action:** Stephen built self-reflection, accountability, and pattern recognition into Claude Code. He solved the same three needs your coaching addresses (Journal, One commitment, Patterns) — but through code, not conversation. Most founders can't do this. That's your gap.
**Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7432396771709947904/

**Key insight for mywellnessgame:**
"The most benefit comes from work that would never have happened in the first place because it was far too expensive to do." — This is exactly what your coaching does. Founders know they should reflect, commit, and find patterns. They never do it because it feels too expensive relative to urgent work. You make the cost zero by packaging it into their existing workflow.
