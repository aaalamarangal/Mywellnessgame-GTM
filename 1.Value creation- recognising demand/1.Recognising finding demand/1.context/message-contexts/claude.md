# Message-contexts — claude.md
Parent: CLAUDE.md | Recognising finding demand

## Purpose
This folder contains the translation layer.
After reading Debt-contexts to understand the founder, Claude reads this folder to understand HOW to write the message.

## What Lives Here

### sources.md
Lessons from coaches, mentors and influencers that directly shape how Shiva recognises demand and messages founders.
Each source answers a specific question in the thinking path:

```
Rob Snyder        → WHEN to message (blocked vs coping)
Yusuf Ahmed       → WHAT the pipeline looks like (signal → bridge → voice)
Aleksander        → WHERE to start the message (where the job breaks)
Robert Kaminski   → HOW to make the message stand out (differentiation)
Stephen Whitworth → WHO you compete against (DIY AI systems, not other coaches)
```

### inertia-types.md
The 4 mental models founders use to justify doing nothing.
Every message is written against one of these — not against another tool or coach.

```
1. Status quo        — friction is known, accepted, already budgeted
2. Internal solution — "I could build this myself"
3. Ad hoc workaround — fragile combo of tools that technically works
4. Not a priority    — nice to solve but not urgent right now
```

### signal-bridge-voice.md
The translation pipeline from founder signal to message.
Great outreach is a pipeline, not an art. (Yusuf Ahmed)

```
Signal → find something specific about the founder
Bridge → connect the signal to the inertia they're stuck in
Voice  → express it naturally with no pitch
```

## How to Use This Folder

1. Read signal-bridge-voice.md — walk through all 3 steps before writing anything
2. Read inertia-types.md — identify which of the 4 mental models you are writing against
3. Read sources.md — identify which source principle is most relevant to this founder's signal
4. Write the message — under 100 words, one question, lead with what you sensed

## The Core Logic
Signal → Bridge → Voice
Every message breaks one specific mental model of doing nothing.
If you don't know which inertia you're writing against — you don't have a message yet.
If you don't have a real signal — you don't have a message yet.
If your voice has more than one question or exceeds 100 words — rewrite before sending.
