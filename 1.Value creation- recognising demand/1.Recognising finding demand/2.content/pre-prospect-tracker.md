# Pre-Prospect Tracker
Parent: CLAUDE.md | demand-signals.md | demand-tollgates.md

## Purpose
Quick-reference list of founders where messages are being tested.
These are not prospects yet — they are learning opportunities.
Detailed signal logs live in demand-signals.md. This is the dashboard.

## Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Sent** | Message sent, waiting for reply |
| **T1 logged** | Tollgate 1 assessed — did I lead with what I sensed? |
| **Silent** | 48+ hours, no reply — assess at Tollgate 2 |
| **Replied** | Founder replied — move to Tollgate 3 |
| **Deeper** | Senses picked up founder going deeper — strong signal |
| **Pulled away** | Senses picked up founder pulling away — weak signal |

## Removed

| Founder | Reason | Signal kept in |
|---|---|---|
| Adarsh Pal | Coping not Blocked — weak signal | demand-signals.md (language useful for debt-psychology.md) |

---

## Observations

**Pattern so far:**
- Both active founders classified as Founder A
- Both in Context Debt, Situation A+B
- No Founder B or C observations yet
- No replies yet — Tollgate 2 assessment needed for both

## Rules
1. Add every founder you message here — even if it's just a comment
2. Include the signal link — the specific post or comment where you spotted them
3. Update tollgate status as it changes
4. If a founder replies and goes deeper — flag them as a potential prospect
5. Detailed signal analysis stays in demand-signals.md — this is dashboard only
