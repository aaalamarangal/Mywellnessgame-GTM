### Thenuka Karunaratne

#### Interaction 1

**Signal**
- Post link: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thenuka_running-a-company-doesnt-get-easier-or-harder-activity-7428128336528416769-r6JV/
- What they said (exact quote): "Running a company doesn't get easier or harder as you grow. That's the wrong way to think about it. Most of what feels hard hasn't actually been about the stage of the company, or even the problem we're facing. The bigger factor has been how I relate to the problem. If every difficult task is something that should stress you out, then you're basically committing to being stressed all the time. The things that have helped most are pretty simple: noticing what's actually bothering me, reframing the situation instead of fighting it, and talking it through with people who can help me see it differently. Over time, I've realized that most stress doesn't come from the situation itself. It comes from the story we attach to it."
- Coping or Blocked? (Rob Snyder): Blocked — can't relate to problems differently without support
- Founder type: A
- Business type: B
- Situation type: A+B
- Debt stage: Context Debt — lacks concepts/qualities to relate to problems differently
- Where the job breaks (Aleksander): At the moment of relating to the problem — the story attached to it becomes the enemy

- What you sent (exact text): "Janet Lee 🌤️ 💜 Love the culture that is present in the team! Thenuka Karunaratne 🌤️ This is lived experience and its meaningful that you are vulnerably sharing with us. 'The things that have helped most are pretty simple: noticing what's actually bothering me, reframing the situation instead of fighting it, and talking it through with people who can help me see it differently.' As part of understanding how founders regulate themselves, I have few questions: How do you reframe the situation (Do you journal physically or provide context to your AI assistant)? When you talk through with people, is it like a team culture there where you process challenging situations in a team meet, or do you talk to a friend?"

**Tollgate log**
- Tollgate 1 — Did I lead with what I sensed or with my solution? Yes — sensed her lived experience with regulation and led with that.
- Tollgate 2 — What do my senses tell me about the silence or reply? No reply yet
- Tollgate 3 — Did my senses pick up them going deeper or pulling away? *(pending reply)*
- What I learned: *(to be added)*

- Post link: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thenuka_ive-learned-to-pay-attention-to-when-a-problem-activity-7429581653439614976-DI2N/
- What they said (exact quote): "I've learned to pay attention to when a problem feels unusually hard. When that happens, I ask myself a simple question: Do I actually have the right tool for this? That's where people matter. I believe the most valuable knowledge I've learned has come from conversations with people who've been through something similar before. Not because they have a playbook to hand you, but because they can listen, ask better questions, and help you see the situation more clearly. That kind of knowledge requires dialogue. You can't really download it."
- Coping or Blocked? (Rob Snyder): Blocked — can't solve hard problems alone, needs dialogue
- Founder type: A
- Business type: B
- Situation type: A+B
- Debt stage: Context Debt — needs people who've been through it, can't download the knowledge
- Where the job breaks (Aleksander): At the moment of facing an unusually hard problem alone

- What you sent (exact text): "I had asked you a question for your earlier post: 'Running a company doesn't get easier or harder as you grow. That's the wrong way to think about it.' I got my answers in this :) This feels very poetic and when I look back, most of my high friction challenges were handled through people and they can not be downloaded as well! Im trusting that I can yearn from life for these moments to be present when ever there is a need!"

**Tollgate log**
- Tollgate 1 — Did I lead with what I sensed or with my solution? Yes — sensed the resonance with my own experience of needing people for hard problems.
- Tollgate 2 — What do my senses tell me about the silence or reply? No reply yet
- Tollgate 3 — Did my senses pick up them going deeper or pulling away? *(pending reply)*
- What I learned: *(to be added)*

- What you sent (exact text): "Understanding founder regulation workflow. Hello Ross, I have been following Rob Snyder's work and I got to know you when you had commented in one of his posts. I have been understanding how you integrate taking breaks from work by camping in nature, being there for your kid and sharing vulnerably about the personal/work challenges. I saw that you had commented this in Thenuka Karunaratne's post: wish this was my usual state."

- What they said (exact quote): "Everyone wants to lead. Very few learn to manage themselves first. Before you lead a team, a project, or a growing startup — you must lead your habits, emotions, time, and decisions. If you can't manage your distractions, your reactions under pressure, your calendar, your energy, your consistency — you won't be able to manage people. In early-stage building, especially without a formal setup, self-management becomes your operating system. Master yourself first. Leadership follows."
- Coping or Blocked? (Rob Snyder): Coping — has the concept but sharing it as wisdom, not expressing personal pain
- Founder type: A
- Business type: A
- Situation type: A+A
- Debt stage: Context Debt — lacks concepts/qualities around self-management as foundation for leadership
- Where the job breaks (Aleksander): At the moment of trying to lead without first managing self
