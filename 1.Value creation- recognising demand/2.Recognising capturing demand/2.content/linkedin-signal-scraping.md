What they said (exact quote): "Most of what feels hard hasn't actually been about the stage of the company, or even the problem we're facing. The bigger factor has been how I relate to the problem... it comes from the story we attach to it."

FEEL
What game? (Macro): Acute stress, trying to relate to problems differently
What's missing? (Context): Lacks the concept of how to reframe consistently — needs people to help him see it

FIRE
Message sent: "Janet Lee 🌤️ 💜 Love the culture that is present in the team! Thenuka Karunaratne 🌤️ This is lived experience and its meaningful that you are vulnerably sharing with us. 'The things that have helped most are pretty simple: noticing what's actually bothering me, reframing the situation instead of fighting it, and talking it through with people who can help me see it differently.' As part of understanding how founders regulate themselves, I have few questions: How do you reframe the situation (Do you journal physically or provide context to your AI assistant)? When you talk through with people, is it like a team culture there where you process challenging situations in a team meet, or do you talk to a friend?"

Word count: ~100+

FILE
Tollgate 1 — Did I lead with their feeling or my solution? Mixed — quoted his words but then asked multiple questions and introduced my framing ("founder regulation")
Tollgate 2 — Silence. Likely the translation — message was too long, multiple questions, introduced my language instead of staying in his.
Tollgate 3 — N/A

What I learned: Multiple questions dilute the message. Stay in their language, not mine.

What they said (exact quote): "That kind of knowledge requires dialogue. You can't really download it."

FEEL
What game? (Macro): Acute stress, can't solve hard problems alone
What's missing? (Context): Needs people who've been through it — can't download the knowledge

FIRE
Message sent: "I had asked you a question for your earlier post: 'Running a company doesn't get easier or harder as you grow. That's the wrong way to think about it.' I got my answers in this :) This feels very poetic and when I look back, most of my high friction challenges were handled through people and they can not be downloaded as well! Im trusting that I can yearn from life for these moments to be present when ever there is a need!"

Word count: ~80

FILE
Tollgate 1 — Did I lead with their feeling or my solution? His feeling — but no question asked. Message was a reflection, not an opener.
Tollgate 2 — Silence. Likely the translation — no question meant no reason to reply.
Tollgate 3 — N/A

What I learned: A message without a question gives the founder nothing to respond to. Reflection alone doesn't create a reply.

What they said (exact quote): "Wish this was my usual state!"

FEEL
What game? (Macro): Acute stress, expressing absence of a regulated state
What's missing? (Context): Lacks the concept of what regulation looks like as a daily practice

FIRE
Message sent (DM): "Understanding founder regulation workflow. Hello Ross, I have been following Rob Snyder's work and I got to know you when you had commented in one of his posts. I have been understanding how you integrate taking breaks from work by camping in nature, being there for your kid and sharing vulnerably about the personal/work challenges. I saw that you had commented this in Thenuka Karunaratne's post: wish this was my usual state."

Tollgate 1 — Did I lead with their feeling or my solution? His feeling — but no question asked. Ended by quoting him back without opening a conversation.
Tollgate 2 — Silence. Likely the translation — no question, no reason to reply. Also DM from a stranger with no clear ask may feel intrusive.
Tollgate 3 — N/A

What I learned: Quoting someone's words back without a question is observation, not conversation. The message needs to open a door, not just hold up a mirror.

Signal link: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nickangtc_ive-been-thinking-a-lot-about-habits-lately-activity-7426524136853856256-IEq-/
What they said (exact quote): "I have no system for knowing if I'm actually doing what I say I do, or where the gaps are."

FEEL
What game? (Nano): Stuck in an invisible pattern — has been doing habits for a year but can't see what they add up to
What's missing? (Formula): Has the concept and the discipline, lacks the tracking workflow

FIRE
Message sent: "The part that hit me — 'I have no system for knowing if I'm actually doing what I say I do.' You've been showing up at 5am for a year, the discipline is clearly there. But you can't see what it's adding up to. When you say you don't know where the gaps are — is it that you don't know which habits are actually moving the needle vs just feeling productive?"
