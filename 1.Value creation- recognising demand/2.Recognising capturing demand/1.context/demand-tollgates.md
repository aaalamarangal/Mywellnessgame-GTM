# Demand Tollgates
Parent: CLAUDE.md | daily-message-log.md

## Purpose
Tollgates are checkpoints that position you to observe what happens after a message is sent.
You have no control over founder responses — only over your messaging at each checkpoint.

The orientation: trust what your senses pick up. Not analyzing the founder from outside — noticing what you sense from inside.

## Tollgate 1 — Did I lead with what I sensed?
**When:** Immediately after sending
**Question to ask yourself:** Did I lead with what I sensed or with my solution?
**What to log:** Your honest self-assessment

**Signs I led with my senses:**
- Message was under 100 words
- Referenced their exact words
- Asked one genuine question
- Something in me recognized their experience before I wrote

**Signs I led with my solution:**
- Message explained your framework
- Asked for a call
- Felt like a pitch

## Tollgate 2 — What do my senses tell me about the silence or reply?
**When:** 48 hours after sending
**Question to ask yourself:** What do my senses tell me about the silence or reply?
**What to log:** Reply / Silence / Reaction (like/comment)

**If reply:** Move to Tollgate 3
**If silence:** Sub-question — Was it the signal, the translation, or the timing?

---

## Tollgate 3 — Did my senses pick up them going deeper or pulling away?
**When:** When reply comes in
**Question to ask yourself:** Did my senses pick up them going deeper or pulling away?
**What to log:** Their exact words in the reply

**If they went deeper:** Strong signal — continue the conversation
**If they pulled away:** Weak signal — note what didn't land
