# Demand Tollgates
Parent: CLAUDE.md | daily-message-log.md

## Purpose
Tollgates are checkpoints that position you to observe what happens after a message is sent.
You have no control over founder responses — only over your messaging at each checkpoint.

---

## Tollgate 1 — Was it the right signal?
**When:** Immediately after sending
**Question to ask yourself:** Did I lead with their feeling or my solution?
**What to log:** Your honest self-assessment

**Signs it was right:**
- Message was under 100 words
- Referenced their exact words
- Asked one genuine question

**Signs it was wrong:**
- Message explained your framework
- Asked for a call
- Felt like a pitch

---

## Tollgate 2 — Did they reply?
**When:** 48 hours after sending
**Question to ask yourself:** Reply or silence — what does this tell me?
**What to log:** Reply / Silence / Reaction (like/comment)

**If reply:** Move to Tollgate 3
**If silence:** Was it the signal, the translation, or the timing?

---

## Tollgate 3 — What did the reply reveal?
**When:** When reply comes in
**Question to ask yourself:** Did they go deeper into their pain or did they deflect?
**What to log:** Their exact words in the reply

**If they went deeper:** Strong signal — continue the conversation
**If they deflected:** Weak signal — note what didn't land
